This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) so you can just clone the repo locally and start it with:
> npm start



ToDo List:

- [ ] testing -- added basic testing
- [x] comment the code
- [ ] fix responsiveness (overflow related?) -- partially fixed
- [ ] images to sprites
- [ ] fix url preview on different platforms
